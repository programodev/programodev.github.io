Print even numbers from 1 to 100 using **while** loop:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
  int i=2;
  while(i<=100){
    printf("%d\n",i);
    i+=2;
  }
return 0;
}
```

Explanation:<br>
We first initialise a variable i=2 of type int. We took 2 because even numbers start with 2. Then we used **while** loop with a condition that i should be less or equal to 100. The while loop repeats the instruction inside the loop as long as i is less than or equal to 100. So the loop will run for i = 2, 4, 6, 8, …, 100. If i becomes greater than 100, the loop stops. While looping we use print function to display the values of i that satisfy the condition. We use i+=2 to increase the i value by 2. i+=2 means i=i+2.
